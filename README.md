Add text you want to look out for in the bad_mods.txt
Each mod should be on a separate line in the bad_mods.txt

Open the mods_detector.exe
Click the button to start (or stop)

Hold left shift in game and hover over an item -- if it contains any of the mods, the windows will play the annoying beeping sound.

Known issues:
The beeping sound will continue if you hold shift while not hovering over an item right after you hold it over item with bad mods. (the clipboard won't get updated os it will keep beeping reacting to previous data)
